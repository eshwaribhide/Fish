## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 5

Under each of the following elements below, indicate below where your
TAs can find:

- the data definition, including interpretation, of penguin placements for setups 
  - https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/bayview/blob/9fb82c4f9fa1512a6c28c79fbe269adbfd8991a1/Fish/Player/strategy.py#L49-L52

- the data definition, including interpretation, of penguin movements for turns
  - https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/bayview/blob/9fb82c4f9fa1512a6c28c79fbe269adbfd8991a1/Fish/Player/strategy.py#L75-L88
  - https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/bayview/blob/9fb82c4f9fa1512a6c28c79fbe269adbfd8991a1/Fish/Player/strategy.py#L20-L23

- the unit tests for the penguin placement strategy 
  - https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/bayview/blob/9fb82c4f9fa1512a6c28c79fbe269adbfd8991a1/Fish/Player/strategy_unit_tests.py#L13-L27

- the unit tests for the penguin movement strategy; 
  given that the exploration depth is a parameter `N`, there should be at least two unit tests for different depths

- any game-tree functionality you had to add to create the `xtest` test harness:
 
  
  - **I did not have to add any extra functionality to create the xtree test harness. But just in case, in terms of answering these questions**:
    - where the functionality is defined in `game-tree.PP`:

    - where the functionality is used in `xtree`
      - https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/bayview/blob/9fb82c4f9fa1512a6c28c79fbe269adbfd8991a1/5/xtree#L237-L239
